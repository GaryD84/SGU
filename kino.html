	<strong><h2>A Look At The Kino - aka flying ball</h2></strong>
	<hr>

	<P>
	the Kino is a device witch records logs of large data streams of video footage, which in turn is used for archiving and for future referencing.
	the ball like shape it almost floats or fly's through the air utilizing the star ship "destiny" internal ship schematic. the crew use these balls to record there daily events and even use them to send messages home.
	of course due to there circumstances the video logs would take an eternity to reach earth due to the overall predicament of essentially being lost in another galaxy.

	the Kino controller allows a user to have overall remote accesses and control to the the Kino itself. utilizing may built in functions such as play back, recording, scouting.
