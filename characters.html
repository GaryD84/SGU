	while treating a HIV infected addict who at the time was putting up a fight when being trated. She has no medical insurance and its not until Eli joins the Icarus project that the air foce pays for her exspenses in return for eli's help.
	He is later sent to the ship Destiny as part of the group of refugees fleeing the Lucian Alliance attack.
