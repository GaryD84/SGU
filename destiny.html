					<strong><h2>An Insight To Destiny</h2></strong>
					<hr>





					<p>
					not long after the creation of the stargates, the ancients found a pattern in the Cosmic microwave radiation recognizing that the pattern could not have been natural in origin.
					the ancients came to the idea that its presence suggested some form of order to the universe never thought possible. possibly some kind of message, however the message was broken up into many pieces and could not be recovered.
					to that end they devoted there efforts of an entire generation to the construction of destiny. the purpose of this was to find and reassemble the broken message. this was a competing project with city ships ,which had the same mission as destiny and was in the early design stages of construction when destiny was ready for its mission.
					automated ships were sent ahead of destiny to explore the universe seeding many Stargates along their path. it was their intention to further their knowledge of the universe ,but they abandoned the project as they started researching into ascension itself.
					never the less the destiny ship continued to go from planet to planet and system to system and galaxy to galaxy for  millions of years.

					following the lucian alliance invasion of destiny, Dr. rush discovered the ships bridge along with information about its mission. he attempted to conceal this information with hte belife that nobody else in the crew would be able to understand the implications of his discovery.
					resulting in the death of sargent hunter riley ,when rush programmed Destiny to stop near a planet with a damaged Stargate and later stranding colonel telford after disconnecting destiny from a seed ship that could have provided them with power to redial Earth after the unknown aliens living on the ship tried to drain power from destiny ship.
					the crew only learning about his control of destiny when he departed the ship with young to investigate an empty ship in what turns out to be a battlefield. When their presence on the ship triggers a short engine burn the ship now in ballistic mode is on a path away from destiny.
					Rushs colleague Dr. amanda perry who had previously helped fix the FTL engine crisis in the void is brought on board via the long range communication stones rush uses a series of mathmatical equations to communicate the location of destinys bridge to Dr.perry.
					it didnt occur to rush ,however that eli automatically records all Kino footage, which was how rush was communicating with perry all along and at the same time solves the same equations leading to him brody and volker locating the bridge as well.
