<p><strong>Star Gate Universe is tv spin off of the precedding tv series beter know as Star Gate or SG1 </strong>
The stargate command created the Icarus base on a remote planet. this Stargate is powered by large naquadria deposits throughout the core.
The team led by DR.rush come to the conclustion that the power from that core could potentially allow them to use a 9th chevron code to dial out into the Stargate
which would allow them access to several locations much further and beyound there very own galaxy system.
but the lack and the means to translate the writing of the ancients into some form of understandable code/language proves difficult to figure out how to dial out properly.
Dr.rush designs a game used on earth to find brilliant minds to interpret the puzzle, which eli Wallace a young mathematics genius solves.
Although Eli is reluctant to become involved, he is brought to Icarus base along with a contingent of guests of honor aboard the hammond a daedalus class space ship battlecruiser.
the guests include senator armstrong, who funds the Icarus Project and his daughter Chloe. They are introduced to the bases military staff,
led by Colonel Everett Young, Colonel David Telford, First Lieutenants Matthew Scott and Tamara Johansen, and Master Sergeant Ronald Greer.
